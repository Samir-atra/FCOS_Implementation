- the focal loss and the FPN network are included in the TensorFlow API.

- computation resources are so limited (acer aspire laptop) but will work on a sample of the dataset (around 1000 images) until 
get to the training stage.
- the dataset json file keys are: info, images, licenses, annotations, categories.

- still to learn the format of the labels from the paper and then creat the array for 
them and prepare the data set for next steps

- best version of FCOS uses ResNeXt instead of ResNet.

- the format of the labels for the bounding box input is Bi = (x0 , y0 , x1 , y1 , c(i)) where the points are for the top-left and right-bottom 
and the image class.

- class = 0 means does not belong to a class

- the outputs of the model are three, classification, center-ness and regression, where the resilts are as follows:
* the classification gives 80D class vector
* the regression gives out the 4D bounding box vector
* the centerness is a value get calculated from the regression outputs.
