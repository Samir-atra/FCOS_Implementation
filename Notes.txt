- the focal loss and the FPN network are included in the TensorFlow API.

- computation resources are so limited (acer aspire laptop) but will work on a sample of the dataset (around 1000 images) until 
get to the training stage.
- the dataset json file keys are: info, images, licenses, annotations, categories.

- still to learn the format of the labels from the paper and then creat the array for 
them and prepare the data set for next steps

- best version of FCOS uses ResNeXt instead of ResNet.

- the format of the labels for the bounding box input is Bi = (x0 , y0 , x1 , y1 , c(i)) where the points are for the top-left and right-bottom 
and the image class.

- class = 0 means does not belong to a class

- the outputs of the model are three, classification, center-ness and regression, where the results are as follows:
* the classification gives 80D class vector
* the regression gives out the 4D bounding box vector
* the centerness is a single layer branch supresses the low quality bounding boxes and it dipects the normalized distance from the location 
to the center of the object that the location is responsible for.

- having trouble installing tensorflow-models on any PC but it works perfectly on colab
- looking for the implementation of the intersection over union loss function in PyTorch:
* in the PyTorch implementation there is a function named sigmoid focal loss, and other function considering the region of interest.
* iou loss in fcos_core/layers....... giou is mentioned there so need to further check. 
- the augmentations used in the PyTorch version is random horizontal flip, and not augmenting but things are being normalized.
- there is something in the fcos_core/layers called smooth_l1_loss with beta, not sure what it might be, (it is used in the roi_heads/keypoint_head)

- must read maskrcnn paper

- another file for losses is fcos_core/modeling/rpn/fcos/ 
- the RoIAlign and pool are specific for segmentation of RCNN
- remember that the loss function takes the networks prediction and the ground truth label.
