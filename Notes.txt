- the focal loss and the FPN network are included in the TensorFlow API.

- computation resources are so limited (acer aspire laptop) but will work on a sample of the dataset (around 1000 images) until 
get to the training stage.
- the dataset json file keys are: info, images, licenses, annotations, categories.

- still to learn the format of the labels from the paper and then creat the array for 
them and prepare the data set for next steps

- best version of FCOS uses ResNeXt instead of ResNet.

- the format of the labels for the bounding box input is Bi = (x0 , y0 , x1 , y1 , c(i)) where the points are for the top-left and right-bottom 
and the image class.

- class = 0 means does not belong to a class

- the outputs of the model are three, classification, center-ness and regression, where the results are as follows:
* the classification gives 80D class vector
* the regression gives out the 4D bounding box vector
* the centerness is a single layer branch supresses the low quality bounding boxes and it dipects the normalized distance from the location 
to the center of the object that the location is responsible for.

- having trouble installing tensorflow-models on any PC but it works perfectly on colab
- looking for the implementation of the intersection over union loss function in PyTorch:
* in the PyTorch implementation there is a function named sigmoid focal loss, and other function considering the region of interest.
* iou loss in fcos_core/layers....... giou is mentioned there so need to further check. 
- the augmentations used in the PyTorch version is random horizontal flip, and not augmenting but things are being normalized.
- there is something in the fcos_core/layers called smooth_l1_loss with beta, not sure what it might be, (it is used in the roi_heads/keypoint_head)

- must read maskrcnn paper

- another file for losses is fcos_core/modeling/rpn/fcos/ 
- the RoIAlign and pool are specific for segmentation of RCNN
- remember that the loss function takes the networks prediction and the ground truth label.


Oct/28/2024--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- after loading the data and implementing an initial version of the IOU loss now start building the model and for that
a close study and understanding for the Resnet50 needs to be conducted.


Oct/31/2024 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- today started working on building the model.
- there is no FPN implementation in other than tensorflow models, so can't work without it.
- installing tensorflow models or one of it's parts is more complex than a PIP installation.
- need to clone the models repository and try installing parts of it.

Dec/13/2024 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- to answer the check requiest above: the GIoU: penalizing the union area over the circumscribed rectangleâ€™s area in
IoU Loss.
- today will be implementing the FPN layer-by-layer from keras documantation in the RetinaNet model, and start 
working on implementing the heads of classification, regression and center-ness.
- to implement the iou loss the inheretance from the keras loss class might fix it, so check the custom loss 
tensorflow implementation.

Jan/08/2025 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- next step is most likly to connect the heads to the FPN and ResNet.
- consider creating a branch on tensorflow models repository and work on it instead of the provate repository.

Feb/08/2025 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- using the keras documentation for the RetinaNet model implementation was able to build the model with the parts
backbone, pyramid, heads and have a full class for FCOS, now to get the loss function working and compile the model.
- the IOULoss implementation was found out from the PyTorch implementation and the research paper psudo code.

Feb/17/2025 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- creating the fcos loss class came to fix the error and move to the next steps but later it should be reviewed.
