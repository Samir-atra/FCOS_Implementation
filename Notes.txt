- the focal loss and the FPN network are included in the TensorFlow API.

- computation resources are so limited (acer aspire laptop) but will work on a sample of the dataset (around 1000 images) until 
get to the training stage.
- the dataset json file keys are: info, images, licenses, annotations, categories.

- still to learn the format of the labels from the paper and then creat the array for 
them and prepare the data set for next steps
