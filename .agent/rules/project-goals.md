- this project is an implementation of the FCOS model from the research papers: /home/samer/Documents/Beedoo/FCOS/FCOS_Implementation/Literature/FCOS_fully convolutional one stage object detection.pdf
 /home/samer/Documents/Beedoo/FCOS/FCOS_Implementation/Literature/FCOS: A Simple and Strong Anchor-free Object Detector.pdf

which is made to be fully built with tensorflow and replicaes the same results reported in the research paper.
